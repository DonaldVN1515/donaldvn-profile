                            Hi! My name is Quoc Viet, I'm a creative designer and developer. I enjoy creating eye candy
                            solutions for web and mobile applications. I'd love to work on yours, too!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I traveled a very atypical path, both personally and professionally. I was born in Cameroon
                            and raised in 6 different countries and 3 continents. I speak English, French and Spanish
                            fluently. I have been good at math and science since my childhood, studying and obtaining a
                            Masterâ€™s Degree in Electrical Engineering. After working in that field for a couple of
                            years, I decided to learn design on my own and have been working as a product designer and
                            front end developer since July, 2007.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the greatest strenghs about being a designer with an engineer background is that not
                            only I can handle the graphical aspects of a project, but I can also fully understand,
                            participate and even lead the technical aspects of those same projects.
